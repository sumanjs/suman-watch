remove usages of require, so as to avoid caching files that may change

create pool of bash workers beforehand? => can't set env and cwd after the fact?

async lib types => https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/async/index.d.ts#L112

suman --watch x --watch y

should not cause problems

only if the expected number of watched files in the worker does not match, should
we throw an error.

suman --watch x --exec=""
suman --watch . --exclude="" --include="" --exec=""
suman --watch-as-per="zam"

make sure watch path passed by user does not include a directory below the project

process.stdin should listen for rs for "restart", and this will restart the watcher.
process.stdin should listen for rr for "rerun", and this will rerun the most recent test.

// move the transpilation code to suman-utils, so that suman can reference it too?

support hooking into transpilation "hot"/live watch processes, so we don't have to transpile from scratch
in other words, hook into tsc -w

create bats test with bash
